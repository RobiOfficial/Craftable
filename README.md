Craftable is a powerful plugin that adds crafting recipes for blocks and items that don't have official recipes or are otherwise locked behind rare structures, loot tables, or challenges.

Everyone is welcome to participate in improving Craftable. You can suggest ideas, report bugs, or contribute on GitHub/Discord.
